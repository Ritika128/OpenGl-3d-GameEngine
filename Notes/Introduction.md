OpenGL is a **graphics API**. API stands for *application program interface*. It allows us to access our GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and perform functions using it.

OpenGL is one of the many graphics APIs available in the market. Examples of a few others are:
- Direct3D
- Vulcan
- Metal

At its core, OpenGL is a specification that basically lists that so and so function should take so and so parameters and perform so and so task.

An advantage of OpenGL is that it is a cross-platform API.
